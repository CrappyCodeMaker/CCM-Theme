# Color formats

Color values can be defined in the RGB color model with an alpha channel for transparency. As format, the following hexadecimal notations are supported: **#RGB**, **#RGBA**, **#RRGGBB** and **#RRGGBBAA**. R (red), G (green), B (blue), and A (alpha) are hexadecimal characters (0-9, a-f or A-F). The three-digit notation (#RGB) is a shorter version of the six-digit form (**#RRGGBB**) and the four-digit RGB notation (**#RGBA**) is a shorter version of the eight-digit form (**#RRGGBBAA**). For example #e35f is the same color as #ee3355ff.

If no alpha value is defined, it defaults to ff (opaque, no transparency). If alpha is set to 00, the color is fully transparent.

Some colors should not be opaque in order to not cover other annotations. Check the color descriptions to see to which colors this applies.
